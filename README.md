# Hang 10 Ice Cream Summer-yee Report

## The endless wave is out there for ice cream. But can we find it in Oahu? Our task is provide summary statistics for two chosen months. The information will give us a snapshot of weather temperatures to guage whether the dudes & dudettes will be stopping by for a scoop. 

### Our report consists of two technical summary report for the months of June & December. We will cover the following:

  - Deliverable 1: Summary Temperature Statistics for June
  - Deliverable 2: Summary Temperature Statistics for December

### June Summary Statistics
 -  Our goal is to correlate the temperature to the demand for ice cream. We will present our method for finding the target temperature for ice cream. There is one temperature in mind that stands out, 70 degrees. You will find the mean temperature for June above the 70 degree mark and reaching upwards to 85. The minimum is 64, but it's reasonable to believe those temperatures may have been measured during the morning or evening. It is reasonable to believe the temperature in June is a good model for any other month of the year.

### December Summary Statistics
 -  December will need to correlate the temperature to the demand for ice cream. Our target temperature set was 70 degrees & similar to the temperatures of June. You will find the mean temperature for December above the 70 degree mark and reaching upwards to 83. The minimum is 56, but it's reasonable to believe more storms & weather pattern occurred on the Northern Hemisphere during the month of December. The vast majority of the other data is similar to June. If June is a reasonable month for ice cream, December should be too.

## Summary of June & December Temperature Statistics
  - The two data sets for June & December had many similarities. Similar in this case is a good thing because many people think of June as a good month for ice cream. We found the weather in December to be right in a good range for a scoop. While we talk about range, the std deviations were similar and even the overall counts had similar numbers. It's good to compare data with similar traits because we will find it easier to compare items apples to apples.

### Two Additional Queries for Weather in June & December
- **1** The humidity is a major factor in tropical climates. Temperatures can be low with high humidity and create a hotter enviornment, more primed for an ice cream business. We should measure this trait. 

- **2** The wind can play a factor in ice cream as well. No one wants to see sand blown into their ice cream cone. We should measure the windiness of an area to avoid opening our business in higher than typical wind areas.
